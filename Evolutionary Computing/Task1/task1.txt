Task 1. Minigrid envs PPO parameters tuning.
The goal: be able to launch experiments, build tensorboard logs and analyse the results.
Instruction:
1. prepare a conda python environment with required libraries (gymnasium, pytorch, stable-baselines3, minigrid)
2. install minigrid library https://minigrid.farama.org/content/basic_usage/
3. according to assigned list take env assigned to you: env = DistShift, parameter -> batch_size = 64 -> 256
4. take an example from minigrid documentation
5. Launch experiements with PPO algorithm, add tensorboard logs
6. change PPO parameters according to ones that were assigned to you (from google doc). There is a range that you can use to tune.
7. Launch multiple times for each of parameter value (about 3 times)
8. Collect tensorboard plots
9. Put the code, text description and plots in Google Colab ipython file.
10. Send me a link to your Google Colab to email with topic: "rl_lab1_surname_name"
